# 🚀 Next.js Project Setup and Basics

Welcome to the **ALX Project 0x02** – a structured and modern Next.js starter designed to reinforce best practices in building scalable, maintainable frontend applications using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

---

## 📌 Purpose

This repository is part of the ALX Frontend Advanced curriculum and serves as the foundational setup for building a modular, performant, and professional web application. It aims to:

- Demonstrate industry-standard project structure
- Implement reusable and typed React components
- Practice API integration and dynamic rendering
- Apply responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Maintain clean, high-quality, and well-documented code

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** – React Framework for SSR & SSG
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** – Strongly typed JavaScript
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** – Utility-first CSS framework
- **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)** – Code linting and style consistency
- **[JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)** – Fake online REST API for demo data

## 🧱 Best Practices

### 🧩 Project Structure
- Organize components by domain: `common`, `layout`, etc.
- Group interfaces in a dedicated folder
- Separate pages according to routes

### 🧠 Component Design
- Follow Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Build modular and reusable components

### 🔍 Code Quality
- Use ESLint for consistent styling
- Add meaningful comments when necessary

### ⚡ Performance
